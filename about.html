            <h2>A Brief Mission Statement</h2>
            <h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
            <p>
            -  Selecting a major is a much more complex task than it seems to be, and being able to see how everything ties in at once is valuable.  
            This would be especially useful for incoming students trying to decide on a major, or undeclared majors.
            </p>
            <p>
            -  Students in a major often have “tunnel vision” and take college one quarter at a time, not realizing why they have to take specific 
            classes and how it ties into the big picture. Knowing the “map” ahead of time can help them make the right decisions.
            </p>
            <p>Thus we want to improve upon what the school has to offer regarding such resources.</p>

            <h3>What does our app want to accomplish?</h3>
            <p>- Display a variety of “maps”: One for major, one for GE’s, Lower and Upper div… there can be many different combinations</p>
            <p class='tab'>- Selecting one major (including specialization) should show a huge road map with many different paths.</p>
            <p class='tab'>- End nodes will typically be higher division classes.</p>
            <p class="tab">- Maps will come with an accompanying resources section (youtube videos etc).</p>
            <p>- Display individual course series maps:</p>
            <p class="tab">- Because upper division courses are often complex subjects, this road map should help student understand <b>WHY</b> they need to take certain prerequisites.</p>
            <p class="tab">- Should have a feature where hovering over a class in the map explains why this topic is relevant for the end node class.</p>
            
            <h2>Current state of affairs (as of July 2020)</h2>
            <p>
            So far we have created an applet on this website that generates a prerequisite map for a given course in the form of a <a href ='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph' target="_blank">directed acyclic graph</a>.</p>
            </p>
            <p>- We need help designing the website, and adding a ton of other functionality and resources!!</p>
